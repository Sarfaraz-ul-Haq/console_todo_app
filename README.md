# Python To-Do Console App (Functional Approach)


This project is a simple console-based to-do application implemented in Python that operates through a command-line interface. It leverages type hints for enhanced code clarity and supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for task management. This application serves as a practical exercise to understand basic programming constructs.
## Features

- **Create**: Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Read**: View all your tasks with status (completed or not).
- **Update**: Modify task descriptions or mark them as completed.
- **Delete**: Remove tasks from the list.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sarfaraz-ul-Haq/console_todo_app.git
   ```

2. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

After running the script, you can interact with the console to perform CRUD operations:

- **1.** Display todo list
- **2.** Add a todo
- **3.** Update todo
- **4.** Mark todo as done
- **5.** Delete todo
- **6.** Exit
